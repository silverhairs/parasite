# Parasite

<p align='center'> An ultra lightweight state management utility highly inspired by Provider and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasyte'>Parasyte</a> manga.</p>

A Parasite is an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense. In the context of this library, we have a`ParasiteHost` class which is the host; it holds and manipulate the state(nutrients) while the `Parasite` rebuilds the UI according to the host's state.

This is just an experiment, I have absolutely no plan on making this a production-ready project.
